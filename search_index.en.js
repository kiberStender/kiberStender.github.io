Spring security is not a bad thing, completely the opposite, it is very useful and needed in any application, but Spring it requires some effort in this kind of task I'm doing that is unnecessary as Spring forces the user to login so it can manage each user easily for you. Years ago I did the same thing(A application using WebSocket) for a college degree article using Play framework 2.1 and I did not need to add any kind of security for controlling the user so here I did not want to configure security as well, not at least with Spring Security. After 2 weeks of looking I finally found a thread in a brazilian forum teaching it in a simple way using STOMP. As it took me so much time to find it and it was the only working example I found, I decided to write this post giving a few more explanation because this forum thread only fix the user request problem and not teach how to start from ground zero and make your own WebSocket service yourself. So in this post I'll try to teach you how to make a simple Webchat using Spring WebSocket with STOMP without thinking about Spring Security.\nWebSocket definition\nA WebSocket is a connection between an user and the server that only closes when the user requests it or when something happens to the server that forces it to disconnects the user(be it hardware problem, the user being banned for doing innapropriate actions or the server losing connection). Another thing is, unlike a normal Http connection that is one way, that means, you request something and the server answers you using the same connection, in a WebSocket the connection is both ways, so you have one connection and a pool of users connected to the same place. So whatever request the server receives, all connected users will receive the response. Then what is WebSocket used for? For large stream of data such as video and audio like youtube, making it easy to buffer small parts of the video instead of sending it whole to the user. In normal connection you had to keep sending the video to the user and the more time it took for the video to load in the user browser or whatever device being used, the bigger the chance of timeout, not mentioning the overhead to keep this connection opened. More info here.\nThe problem ... and the solution\nWait... I said that there is a 'pool of users' connected to the server and wherever request is sent all users will receive the response, so how does it fit in a 'controlling when to send to everybody or to an user in specific'? Well ... of course, this is a program, a machine code, you can have control over the connections. Each connection is seen as a session by the WebSocket server, so you can send specific data to a specific user by using STOMP. STOMP just do for WebSocket what REST did to Http. You specify url-like structures bound to some class or function and whoever is connected to the WebSocket server can subscribe to these 'url' and listen so other users can send data at any moment and only who's listening to the specific route will receive this data.\nImplementing\nTo start you need to be familiar with Java 7(or newer), Spring boot, WebSocket and STOMP. Thanks guys the tutorial is finished you already know what you need ^^. \nJust kidding =D (it looks like some websites right bael...), but yeah the minimum here is knowledge in Java, Spring and Maven or Gradle(Even though I will use both for demonstration I won't explain how they work and I will focus more on Maven), I'll try to make it easy explaning Spring things in as much details as possible, so if you never used Spring don't worry, you will still not know anything after this post, I mean, don't worry you will know at least how to set it up for a basic project.\nFirst things first\nBe sure that you have Java and Maven (or Gradle) installed. Create a directory (like spring_websocket_specific_user for example).\nIf you are using Maven create a file pom.xml in the root of your directory and copy the following to the file:\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n    xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\"&gt;\n    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;\n\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.websocket.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring_websocket_specific_user&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n    &lt;version&gt;0.1.0&lt;/version&gt;\n\n    &lt;parent&gt;\n        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;version&gt;2.2.1.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;\n    &lt;/parent&gt;\n\n    &lt;dependencies&gt;\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n          &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\n          &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-websocket&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n        &lt;dependency&gt;\n            &lt;groupId&gt;com.jayway.jsonpath&lt;/groupId&gt;\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;json-path&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;\n        &lt;/dependency&gt;\n    &lt;/dependencies&gt;\n\n    &lt;properties&gt;\n        &lt;java.version&gt;1.8&lt;/java.version&gt;\n    &lt;/properties&gt;\n\n    &lt;build&gt;\n        &lt;plugins&gt;\n            &lt;plugin&gt;\n                &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\n                &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n            &lt;/plugin&gt;\n        &lt;/plugins&gt;\n    &lt;/build&gt;\n&lt;/project&gt;\n\nIf you are using Gradle create a file build.gradle in the root of your directory and copy this:\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        mavenCentral()\n    }\n    dependencies {\n        classpath(\"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:2.2.1.RELEASE\")\n    }\n}\n\napply plugin: 'java'\napply plugin: 'eclipse'\napply plugin: 'idea'\napply plugin: 'org.springframework.boot'\napply plugin: 'io.spring.dependency-management'\n\nbootJar {\n    baseName = 'spring_websocket_specific_user'\n    version =  '0.1.0'\n}\n\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n\nsourceCompatibility = 1.8\ntargetCompatibility = 1.8\n\ndependencies {\n    compile(\"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-websocket\")\n    testCompile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test')\n}\n\nThese files will manage Spring dependencies for you downloading everything you'll need to make Spring work. Now, 4 dirs one inside the other: src, then main then java then websocket\nMaven representation\n\nGradle representation\n\nCreating your Main class\nNow let's create the class who will start your program. \nGo to /src/main/java/websocket and create a file named Main.java and add the following\npackage websocket;\n\nimport org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\nimport org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;\n\n@SpringBootApplication\npublic class Main {\n\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n    SpringApplication.run(Main.class, args);\n  }\n}\n\nNow you can run it to test if everything works\nmvn spring-boot:run\n\nor\ngradle bootRun\n\nIf everything went fine you will see something similar to this:\n\nLet's create our WebSocket\nNavigate back to /src/main/java and create the packages org.websocket.spring.config and org.websocket.spring.controller\n\nPS: Before we proceed, be sure that everything you've done so far is correct and you have a working Spring application. You can tell if you have it by looking at the picture above.\nDon't try the rest of the steps if it is not running at this point. Otherwise it will be hard for you to know what is wrong and it will be worse as more you progress.\nNow let's keep going ...\nCreate a new file named WebSocketConfig.java in /src/main/java/org/websocket/spring/config and add the following\npackage org.websocket.spring.config;\n\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.simp.config.MessageBrokerRegistry;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.config.annotation.EnableWebSocketMessageBroker;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.config.annotation.StompEndpointRegistry;\nimport org.springframework.web.socket.config.annotation.WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer;\n\n@Configuration\n@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker\npublic class WebSocketConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {\n\n  @Override\n  public void configureMessageBroker(MessageBrokerRegistry config) {\n    config.enableSimpleBroker(\"/user\", \"/topic\", \"/queue\");\n    config.setApplicationDestinationPrefixes(\"/app\");\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) {\n    registry.addEndpoint(\"/websocket-chat\").withSockJS();\n  }\n}\nSpring built-in support\nSTOMP is just a protocol to make it easier for us sending messages to the server. Before STOMP we had to create data classes full of enums to know which request type it was, perform correct processing flow and return appropriate response because we had only one endpoint in the WebSocket. With STOMP we can create 'internal urls' for actions very similar to Queue applications(Rabbit MQ, Zero MQ, etc), with the difference that when no client is listening to RabitMQ and some data i sent to the Queue, RabbitMQ stores it until someone connects and consumes it, while with STOMP, if nobody is listening to the url and some data is sent, nobody will ever consume that data. So based in the url you can bind a function (like you do with Rest Urls). For this purpose Spring has something nice for us, it pre-defines 3 types of URL: /topic, /queue and /user.\n\n/topic- By creating any endpoint that starts with this root (like /topic/newMember or /topic/disconnectedMember) Spring will send the messages to any connected user in the WebSocket\n/queue- By creating any endpoint that starts with this root (like /queue/register or /queue/unregister) Spring will send the messages only to the user who requested it, like a normal HTTP url. Imagine you want to register to our chat and if you are eligible you want to receive the list of the other connected users but the other users already have this list, so you don't want to send them anything.\n/user- By creating any endpoint that starts with this root (like /user/{username}/msg) Spring will send the messages only to the user in the brackets({username}). Notice that when we implement the /user routes we won't need user {username}, it was just to ilustrate my example.\n\nConfiguration file explanation\nWe created a Spring Configuration class with the annotation @Configuration to configure the base of our WebSockets endpoints. For enableSimpleBroker we set the three 'Spring built-in helpers': /user, /queue, /topic because we will need all of them. /user to redirect specific user chat messages, /queue to register and unregister our user and /topic to spread the word that a new user has entered or left the room.\nThe /app in setApplicationDestinationPrefixes method call is a random name you can give to segregate your WebSocket routes from normal Http routes. Last but not least: addEndpoint call creates our WebSocket in the url we pass as a parameter to connect to our WebSocket in our example you have to use the following string: ws://localhost:9000/websocket-chat(only if you are using an outside WebSocket client app, because in our Javascript internal client we only need to use /websocket-chat).\nNow let's create the data class where we will store the message, who send and who should receive it. Just create a class named WebSocketMessage and add the following(I created this class in the package /src/main/java/org/websocket/spring/controller): \npackage org.websocket.spring.controller;\n\npublic class WebSocketMessage {\n  public final String toWhom;\n  public final String fromWho;\n  public final String message;\n  \n  public WebSocketMessage(final String toWhom, final String fromWho, final String message){\n    this.toWhom  = toWhom;\n    this.fromWho = fromWho;\n    this.message = message;\n  }\n}\n\nNo much explanation is needed(I guess), in a Real World situation of course you would create the basic hashCode, equals and toString, maybe even getters and setters, I prefer the immutable approach, but this is just an example so let's not bother with so much details. So let's create our Spring Controller. Just go to /src/main/java/org/websocket/spring/controller again and create WebSocketController.java file and add the following:\npackage org.websocket.spring.controller;\n\nimport java.util.Set;\nimport java.util.HashSet;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.handler.annotation.MessageMapping;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.handler.annotation.SendTo;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.simp.annotation.SendToUser;\nimport org.springframework.messaging.simp.SimpMessagingTemplate;\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;\n\n@Controller\npublic class WebSocketController {\n  private final SimpMessagingTemplate simpMessagingTemplate;   //1\n  private final Set&lt;String&gt; connectedUsers;     //2\n  \n  public WebSocketController(SimpMessagingTemplate simpMessagingTemplate){ \n    this.simpMessagingTemplate = simpMessagingTemplate; //1\n    connectedUsers = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();  //2\n  }\n  \n  @MessageMapping(\"/register\")  //3\n  @SendToUser(\"/queue/newMember\")\n  public Set&lt;String&gt; registerUser(String webChatUsername){\n    if(!connectedUsers.contains(webChatUsername)) {\n      connectedUsers.add(webChatUsername);\n      simpMessagingTemplate.convertAndSend(\"/topic/newMember\", webChatUsername); //4\n      return connectedUsers;\n    } else {\n      return new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\n    }\n  }\n  \n  @MessageMapping(\"/unregister\")  //5\n  @SendTo(\"/topic/disconnectedUser\")\n  public String unregisterUser(String webChatUsername){\n    connectedUsers.remove(webChatUsername);\n    return webChatUsername;\n  }\n\n  @MessageMapping(\"/message\")  //6\n  public void greeting(WebSocketMessage message){\n    simpMessagingTemplate.convertAndSendToUser(message.toWhom, \"/msg\", message);\n  }\n}\n\nI put comments listing the interesting points here:\n\nStarting from version 4 (I'm not sure) Spring does not need @Autowired to inject objects anymore if you want to initialize them in the constructor. It makes it perfect for creating immutable components or at least decrease variables mutability, so what I did was inject an object of the type SimpMessagingTemplate. This object is what will hellp us to redirect our messages to the correct user.\nIn order to show to the other users who is currently connected so you don't need to guess the user name you want to send a message, I created the Set object that will hold the name of the connected users.\nI created this route to register our user when he connects to our WebSocket. You'll see in the javascript part that this is not automatic, you have to send a message to the url /app/register right after you are connected. The @SendToUser(\"/queue/newMember\") create the endpoint our user will subscribe to (or listen in other words) so when he/she register to our WebSocket the answer/response (whatever the function returns, in this case the Set of connected users) will be sent only to him/her, because if you notice, it is a /queue endpoint.\nI just check if the user already exists in our 'Database' and if so I return an empty Set(you will understand why in the JS part). Otherwise I call simpMessagingTemplate.convertAndSend(\"/topic/newMember\", webChatUsername); to warn the other users that someone just entered the room and then return the list of all users to new connected user. Notice that we are just sending a message to a /topic endpoint, so everybody will receive it.\nHere it's the opposite of our previous function. One user decided to disconnect, so we remove him/her from our 'Database' and then return his/her name to a /topic endpoint to the rest of the users know he/she left. See that here instead of using the simp object I used Spring annotation SendTo, it has the same effect as the function convertAndSend in the SimpMessagingTemplate class. The difference is we can have compiler advantage, because we say what we want to send to the endpoint in the function signature, while in the convertAndSend the parameter is an Object. I used the different approach in the previous function because one cannot send data to two endpoints in one function using the return mechanism, so I returned to the /queue using the language syntax return and used convertAndSend to the /topic endpoint.\nAnd here is where the magic happens. Here we receive a message from the user and using our class WebSocketMessage and extract to whom this message should be sent. In theory the annotation @SendToUser could do the trick to us and redirect the message to the right recipient but to achieve this I learned in all my researches that you have to configure Spring Security, so the framework will log in the user and create a Principal instance for each connected user and using this Principal object it would know to which user redirect the message. I might be wrong but all the time I tried without Spring Security it did not work. So what that brazilian post I mentioned in the begining said was to ignore this annotation and use the method convertAndSendToUser from the class SimpMessagingTemplate and as you will see if you follow the whole tutorial, it works.\n\nNow we have to tell Spring that these classes are Spring components and thus Spring should instantiate them for us, so we will modify our Main class a bit and add Spring component scanner and tell the packages that Spring should scan and do it's magic. So add @ComponentScan({\"org.websocket.spring\"}) in our Main class:\n...\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;\n\n@SpringBootApplication\n@ComponentScan({\"org.websocket.spring\"})\npublic class Main {\n...\n\nDone, now Spring will initiate our @Controller class automatically making our WebSocket backend complete. Very simple right? Well we could finish it here, but I'll make a simple frontend to make it more complete.\nFrontend\nFor frontend I will be even simpler than I was in the backend. I won't use any kind of framework(React.js, Angular, jQuery, anything) but two libraries: SockJs-client and stomp-websocket. The rest will be pure vanilla Javascript. SockJs and Stomp-Websocket gives us am eaiser way to control our WebSocket client and the latter adds STOMP, so we don't have to manually do anything when connected to our WebSocket server. To add SockJs and Stomp-Websocket I will use Webjars instead of manually download the js files and put them in our resources directory. So just add this two depencies in our build file:\nMaven\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.webjars&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;webjars-locator-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.webjars&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;sockjs-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;1.0.2&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.webjars&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;stomp-websocket&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;2.3.3&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n\nGradle\ncompile(\"org.webjars:webjars-locator-core\")\ncompile(\"org.webjars:sockjs-client:1.0.2\")\ncompile(\"org.webjars:stomp-websocket:2.3.3\")\n\nIf you have never used nor heard about Webjar it is just javascript libraries packaged in a Java jar package, so you can manage them as normal dependecies via maven, gradle or whatever. Whenever you add these libraries you still have to add them in your HTML file old style:\n....\n&lt;script src=\"/webjar/sockjs-client/1.0.2/sock.min.js\"/&gt;\n....\n\nAs it is annoying to everytime we change the library version we have to go to our HTML files and change the src to reflect the new version I added locator-core Webjar, it helps us removing the verbose to add the version so if you update it, you will not have to change your HTML file:\n....\n&lt;script src=\"/webjar/sockjs-client/sock.min.js\"/&gt;\n....\n\nWebjar does not work only with Javascript but with CSS as well. I am going to use Bootstrap CSS not make it beautiful but to make everything aligned and understandable. So add another dependency in your Build file:\nMaven\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n  &lt;groupId&gt;org.webjars&lt;/groupId&gt;\n  &lt;artifactId&gt;bootstrap&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n  &lt;version&gt;3.3.7&lt;/version&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n\nGradle\ncompile(\"org.webjars:bootstrap:3.3.7\")\n\nI will create only the basics for sending and receiving messages and I won't explain any Javascript language syntax detail or HTML. The only explanation you will have in this section is which objects you have to instantiate, which methods to use and why are we using these so you can do your own modifications easily to adequate to your reality. So let's create our index.html file inside /src/main/resources/static directory and add the following: \n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Webchat WebSocket&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link href=\"/webjars/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n  \n    &lt;div id=\"main-content\" class=\"container\"&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"row text-center\"&gt;\n        &lt;h2&gt;WebChat WebSocket&lt;/h2&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n\n      &lt;br/&gt;\n\n      &lt;div class=\"row text-center\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"col-md-4\"&gt;\n          &lt;label for=\"webchat_username\"&gt;Username:&lt;/label&gt;\n          &lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"webchat_username\" placeholder=\"Put your username here...\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"col-md-1\"&gt;\n          &lt;input type=\"button\" class=\"btn\" id=\"webchat_connect\" value=\"Connect\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"col-md-1\"&gt;\n          &lt;input type=\"button\" class=\"btn\" id=\"webchat_disconnect\" value=\"Disconnect\" disabled=\"true\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n\n      &lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"row text-center\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Connected Users List&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div id=\"chat_user_list\" class=\"row\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n      &lt;div id=\"chat_list\" class=\"row\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n      \n      &lt;div id=\"alerts\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n    &lt;script src=\"/webjars/sockjs-client/sockjs.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"/webjars/stomp-websocket/stomp.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;script src=\"/js/index.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nNow we are going to create our Javascript index.js file inside /src/main/resources/static/js and add the following:\n(function(){\n  function select(str){\n    return document.querySelector(str);\n  }\n  \n  function alertMessage(message, type){\n    let alerts = select(\"#alerts\");\n\n    let el = document.createElement(\"p\")\n    el.innerHTML = message\n    el.classList.add(type)\n    alerts.append(el)\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; alerts.innerHTML = '', 5000)\n  }\n  \n  function drawChat(chatUsername){\n    return `&lt;div class=\"row text-center\"&gt;\\n  &lt;h3&gt;Chat with ${chatUsername}&lt;/h3&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;\\n&lt;div id=\"chat_messages_${chatUsername}\" class=\"row\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n&lt;br/&gt;\\n&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\\n  &lt;div class=\"col-md-4\"&gt;&lt;textarea id=\"chat_input_${chatUsername}\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n  &lt;div class=\"col-md-1\"&gt;&lt;input type=\"button\" id=\"chat_send_to_${chatUsername}\" value=\"Send\"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;`\n  }\n\n  function getChat(chatList, chatName){\n    let chatRoom = chatList.querySelector(`#chat_${chatName}`)\n    if(chatRoom === null){\n      let el = document.createElement(\"div\")\n      el.id = `chat_${chatName}`\n      el.innerHTML = drawChat(chatName)\n      el.classList.add('row')\n      chatList.append(el)\n      return el;\n    } else {\n      return chatRoom\n    }\n  }\n\n  function clickSendButton(chatRoom, toWhom, stompClient, username) {\n    chatRoom.querySelector(`#chat_send_to_${toWhom}`).addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {\n      let msgInput = chatRoom.querySelector(`#chat_input_${toWhom}`)\n      let msg = msgInput.value;\n\n      if (msg &amp;&amp; msg !== '') {\n        stompClientSendMessage(stompClient, '/app/message', JSON.stringify({\n          toWhom: toWhom,\n          fromWho: username,\n          message: msg\n        }))\n        let messages = chatRoom.querySelector(`#chat_messages_${toWhom}`);\n        messages.innerHTML += `&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"col-md-1\"&gt;Me:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"col-md-8\"&gt;${msg}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`\n        msgInput.value = ''\n      } else {\n        alertMessage(`Message to user [${toWhom}] cannot be empty !!!`, \"bg-danger\")\n      }\n    }, true)\n  }\n  \n  function displayMessage(chatList, stompClient, username, {fromWho, message}){\n    let chatRoom = getChat(chatList, fromWho);\n    let messages = chatRoom.querySelector(`#chat_messages_${fromWho}`);\n    messages.innerHTML += `&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"col-md-1\"&gt;${fromWho}:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"col-md-8\"&gt;${message}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`\n\n    clickSendButton(chatRoom, fromWho, stompClient, username)\n\n  }\n\n  function displayUserList(userList, chatList, username, stompClient){\n    const lis = userList.length === 0 ?

Everything above it is just function declaration. So now I will do the samne as before and put comments showing the important things using numbers:\n\nFirst things first. After checking the username to see if it's valid or not we connect to our WebSocket, if you look at the function connect you'll see that it's very simple. Just give the url to our WebSocket server, the one we configured in the WebSocketConfig java class: /websocket-chat.\nNow we wil start to subscribe to endpoints enabling us to receive messages. The first endpoint we will subscribe is the newMember one to find out if we were registered or not. Remember I said it's not automatic and we should send a message to register? So, before sending this message we have to subscribe to the 'return' endpoint otherwise the message will be sent in a moment we are not listening to it. Another point here, if you look at the Java function I return an empty list if the username already exists. This is just me saying: 'Your username already exists, try another one'. You can do this differently, you can create a class representing failure or success for example, but what you cannot do is return 'null'. I tried, it does not work, the server never sends the message.\nIn order to keep receiving alerts when other users connect we subscribe to the /topic version of the above endpoint. If you remember, the /queue/newMember will return us a list with all connected users, and the /topic one only the name of whoever connected. Another difference is that because we use /queue we will only receive once the whole list of users, so to keep up to date we need the /topic one. You might notice that I do not check when we connect to ignore our name, so feel free to fix this bug ^^\nNow that we subscribed to the endpoint that will tell us if we were registered to the chat room or not, we can finally register. So I sent a message to /app/register and actually register\nHere I'm disabling the connect button so you don`t accidentally reconnect and enabling the disconnect one.\nHere I'm attaching a function to disconnect us when we click in the disconnect button.\nHere is a simple reaction to when someone leave the chat.\nHere you can see how simple it is to subscribe to a endpoint, you only need to call subscribe method in the StompClient and pass the endpoint you want to subscribe and the callback to react to it's messages.\nThe same goes to how simple it is to send a message to any endpoint. Just call the method send in the StompClient and pass the endpoint and the message itself. Check if the message needs to be converted before sending, like JSON.stringify or whatever.\n\nThe rest is just me trying to make it easier for you to adapt it to whatever you need. Run it and feel free to curse or cumpliment me when I add comments to this blog ^^\nif you want to check the source code please refer to this URL\nBest regards, thanks for your time, I hope I helped you in anyway.

With the popularity of JQuery and the improvents of Ajax (Assynchornous Javascript and XML), now you would not need to put Java/PHP/{any other backend language} code in the middle of your HTML file to generate dynamic stuff that comes from the backend. You can fetch data from wherever server you want and use JQuery to update a single part of your page without full refresh making it looks instantaneous. Because now, you don't need to fetch  a whole HTML page but small JSON/XML texts. \nAs Javascript was becoming popular the syntax and base library started to receive refactories, like the addition of Promises, Import/Export syntax, Async function, Await operator, Arrow functions, Spread syntax, Rest parameters and Destructuring assignment. All of these new features and other ones I haven't added here, made Javascript way better than it was in the past and brought attention to it again.\nRoughly summarized (and not much reliable) story of Node\nIn the beginning there was Javascript in your browser, and it was good(Kind of). But Javascript unlike Java, is a script language(Duh!) and even though it has it's specification dictated by some company and published under the name of ECMA, each browser has it's own way to optmize or implement the specifications. Then in 2008, Google released V8. While it was very nice on Google Chrome, \"some guys\" realized that by making some modification to this engine they could use Javascript not only in the browser but also as a general purpose interpreter, similar to Python. \"These guys\" named it NodeJS.\nA little bit of NPM\nLike what Maven does for Java, they introduced some similar technology named NPM(Node Package Manager) that  download your dependencies, put them in the 'classpath', package, deploy and even publish your application/library. The difference is that you have to install Maven separatedly from Java while NPM comes with Node.\nTo use NPM you simply create a file in the root of your application named package.json with the following (minimal)structure:\n{\n  \"name\": \"MyAppName\", //1\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1-snapshot\", //2\n  \"description\": \"An example package.json\", //3\n  \"engines\": { //4\n    \"node\": \"&gt;=4.0.0\",\n    \"npm\": \"&gt;=4.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": { //5\n    \"run\": \"node app.js\",\n    \"test\": \"call your test library\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {//6\n    \"a: \"1.2.3\",\n    \"b: \"3.2.1\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": { //7\n    \"c: \"1.2.3\",\n    \"d: \"3.2.1\"\n  }\n}\n\nThere are way more properties you can have in your package.json file, but these ones I'm showing, are the most important ones(with the excpetion of engines):\n\nname: This is the name of your application/library\nversion: This is the version of your application/library\ndescription: This is where you put a brief description of what your application/library does. This is useful for others who use your applicationm/library and it is displayed in NPM website\nengines: This field is meant to warn the user about which is the best version for your code to run, so you can use any combination of numbers and comparison operators(==, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=) in the sub fields node and npm that satisfies the condition for your code to run. Like, in the above example I'm saying that if whoever runs my program do not have at least node v12 or higher and npm v6 or higher, the application might not run correctly. \"Might\" because it does not prevent the application to try to run, it will emit a warning but nothing more. if you want it to not run if conditions are not met, you can create in the root of your app a file named .npmrc and put engine-strict=true inside it. .npmrc has more functionalities but, for this post this one is just enough\nscripts: This is where you define the commands to build, build:prod, test, run or whatever you find necessary. Like Maven plugins where you tell maven how to run or compile your application\ndependencies: This is where you define a list of libraries your program dependends on, like React, Angular, MomentJS, etc\ndevDependencies: This is where you define a list of dependencies that will not be packaged with your code. Imagine you are coding in Coffeescript or Typescript. You don't need to package their compilers to your code, because in the end everything becomes Javascript. But not only compilers, for example, Uglyfy is a program that makes your code awful for anybody to read, once it runs it is not needed anymore, so you list it here instead of normal dependencies property.\n\nAfter you create this file, NPM will be used mostly for running your application and 'installing' your dependencies. Installing here is between quotation because unlike Maven, that you have to manually put all dependencies, NPM provide a nice syntax where you download the dependency package and at the same time add it to your package.json file if you do not have this dependency in your dependency list:\nnpm install dependency-a dependency-b\n\nThis syntax is to download the latest version of the dependency-a or dependency-b, if you want to specify the version you can:\nnpm install dependency@1.2.3 dependency-b@^1.0.0\n\nThis ^ between @ and the version means you want the latest version from 1.x.x series, so imagine that today the newest version is 1.1.0, but tomorrow you run this command the newest version is 1.2.0. This will update dependency-b version automatically when downloading it, so you don't have to look everyday in case you are waiting for an update from 1.x.x series to fix a security bug or perfomance issue.\nAnd to add dependencies to the property devDependencies you use a similar syntax. Simply add a --save-dev to your npm install command:\nnpm install --save-dev devDependency-a devDependency-b@^1.0.0 devDependency-c@3.0.0\n\nAnd last but no least, to execute the scripts you created in scripts sections you simply call npm run-script script-name(or a short version npm run script-name)\nnpm run-script run #or npm run run\nnpm run-script test #or npm run test\nInstalling Node and NPM\nI'm not going to detail this process because you can find it very detailed on NodeJS website itself. Go to NodeJS page, choose the appropriate package for your Operating System. If you are using Windows you can simply double click the EXE file and follow the next~next~next~install pattern. If you are on Linux or Mac you can unpackage the tar.xz file you downloaded using any graphical or terminal application you prefer, put the contents in some directory of your choice and then create an Environment Variable named NODE_HOME variable pointing to /path/to/node/ and add it to your PATH environment variable:\n...\nNODE_HOME=/path/to/node\n\nPATH=$PATH:$NODE_HOME/bin\n\nCreate HOME env variable in Windows too, so you can access node via cmd. For more details please refer to this page or this one. As I said, NPM comes together, so once you get Node installed NPM will be installed too. Now simply test if everything is Ok:\n\nIf you prefer, many Linux OSes have package managers and Node is in their repositories so you can install like this:\nsudo pacman -S nodejs #Arch based OSes\nsudo apt-get install nodejs #Debian based\n...# and so on and so forth\nStarting the project\nNow that you understood the minimum about Node and how to get it running on your machine, let's start our Node project as a simple CLI(Command Line Interface) app written in pure JS.\nSo the first thing you have to do is create our app directory. Let's call it node_app:\n\nNow we create our package.json. Very simple one:\n{\n  \"name\": \"Node-example-app\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1-snapshot\",\n  \"description\": \"A simple Node application\",\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"node\": \"&gt;=12.0.0\",\n    \"npm\": \"&gt;=6.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no tests were specified\\\" &amp;&amp; exit 1\"\n  }\n}\n\nPS:The above section is \"copy-able\". It means if you don't want to manually type it, this is a simple text so you can copy and paste. All sections similar to this one allows it. Just pay attention because sometimes I will post a fragment of something you have to change and not the whole file and I'll add some ... (three dots) to denote that from bellow or above it you have to keep the original content\nAs we added engine property to define the minimum Node version we want to guarantee our app will run, we need to finish this config creating .npmrc in our root directory:\nengine-strict=true\n\nPS: Note that I'm using node v12 and npm v6 in our engine property while newest Node is v13. You cannot expect servers to be completely up to date with newer Node version for many reasons like security, stability, etc.\nNext step is to create a src directory and inside this directory create a app.js file in it and as content simply add 'console.log(\"Hello World\")':\n\nOk now we have the minimum for our app. Edit your package.json to add a new script:\n...\n\"scripts\": {\n  ...\n  \"execute\": \"node src/app.js\", \n  ...\n}\n...\n\nAnd execute it with the command I already taught you:\n\nIf you've seen something similar to the below image, congratulations, you just made your first Node CLI application.\nAdding a dependency\nI showed you all possibilities of NPM command to add a dependency but, what exactly is a dependency? A dependency in this context, is an external code that add or extend functionalities to your program. They help us not to reinvent the wheel, so we can focus on the specific parts that these libraries cannot do. It is called dependency for once you add it to your code, it literally depends on that library from that moment on and if it is not in your classpath when running the application your program will not properly run.\nJavascript has support for Date objects that represents manipulation of Years, Months, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds, etc. But, it is known that it is a little hard to handle, specially when you need to convert a date from one TimeZone to another. So there is a third party library, named moment.js, that is specialized in manipulating date/time, giving you more options than built-in Date. Let's add moment to our application to display the date and time for our user, then by adding this library to your dependecy list it will be available in your code like if you had coded it earlier.\nFirst add it to you package.json file using the following command:\nnpm install moment@2.24.0\n\nPS: Use the same version of the library I put above, so in the future this post will still work\nNotice 2 things:\n\nYour package.json file now has a new field named dependencies and momentjs as the only item there:\n\nTwo items were created in your root directory:\n\nA new directory named node_modules. This directory is automatically created whenever you run npm install(and/or it's variations) and it contains all dependencies your app has. If you accidentally delete it, don't worry, when you run npm install, boom, it appears again, for this reason you can ignore this directory using .gitignore, .dockerignore or any ignore[something] in any versioning system\nA new file named package-lock.json. This file is similar to package.json but, with a small difference: It lists all the dependencies trees, making it easier for NPM to install the dependencies later and to verify if there is any conflict, like if package.json is the human readable version and package-lock.json is the machine readable version. It is recomendable to not ignore this file in your versioning system, even though it will be recreated after npm install is executed\n\n\n\n\nNow we update our /src/app.js to import and print the date:\nconst moment = require(\"moment\");\n\nconsole.log(\"It is: \" + moment().format());\n\nRun your app again and see the date appearing:\n\nTesting in Javascript\nYou know, programming is one thing but, testing your code to guarantee it does what you really want it to do is a completely different thing. So, how one test code in Javascript? In Node? One of the most famous libraries for testing that I know in Javascript is called Jest. It is a very complete test suite framework, with assertion support, hooks to setup and tear down, mocking, code coverage and more. First step is to install Jest in our dev-dependency list:\nnpm install --save-dev jest@26.0.1\n\nNotice that our package.json file was updated again and now it has a new field named dev-dependecies and Jest is the only item:\n\nLet's create a separate class named Greetings in a different package/directory. First create javascript directory inside /src. Inside it(javascript) create a package/directory named greetings and finally inside it create a file named Greetings.js and put the given content:\nclass Greetings {\n  constructor(name){\n    this.name = name;\n  }\n  \n  greet(){\n    return \"Hello Mr/Ms \" + this.name;\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports.Greetings = Greetings;\n\nNow come back to the root of our app and create a directory named test, inside it create the same structure we have in our /src:\n\nPS: It is not mandatory to follow the same structure, it is just to make it easier to read and Jest by default looks for a test directory in the root of your project\nNow we code our tests. I'll write only two. One for success and one for \"failure\". Very simple tests as it is just a demonstration. So inside /test/javascript/greetings create our Greetings.test.js file and add the bellow code:\nconst {Greetings} = require('../../../src/javascript/greetings/Greetings.js');\n\nconst greetDev = new Greetings(\"NodeJSDev\");\n\ndescribe('Greetings', function() {\n  describe('#greet()', function() {\n    test('should return \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJSDev\"', function() {\n      //GIVEN\n      const expected = \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJSDev\";      \n      //WHEN\n      const actual = greetDev.greet();      \n      //THEN\n      expect(actual).toBe(expected);\n    });\n    \n    test('should not return \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJSDev \"', function() {\n      //GIVEN\n      const expected = \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJSDev \";      \n      //WHEN\n      const actual = greetDev.greet();      \n      //THEN\n      expect(actual).not.toBe(expected);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nNext step is to modify test script in our package.json to execute Jest for us:\n{\n  ...\n  \"scripts\": {\n    ...\n    \"test\": \"jest\"\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\nRun it!!!\n\nUnit testing and mocking\nNot always your code will be simple enough to not depend on anything but it`s internal code. For example:\n// Hypothetical file user_db_repo.js\nconst DB = require(\"./some_DB_lib\");\n\nclass UserDBRepo {\n getUserBirthdayByID(userID){\n   //Hypothetical DB API\n   const birthdate = DB.query(\"Select u.birthday From User u where u.id = :id\").on(\"id\", userID).execute();\n   if(birthdate === null){\n     throw new Error(\"UserID is invalid or user has no birthdate registered\");\n   } else {\n     return new Date(birthdate);\n   }\n }\n}\nmodule.exports.UserDBRepo = UserDBRepo;\n\nThen you have another class that has a method that receives the user id and return it's age:\n// Hypothetical file user_service.js\nconst {UserDBRepo} = require(\"./user_db_repo.js\");\n\nclass UserService {\n  constructor(){\n    this.userDbRepo = new UserDBRepo();\n  }\n  getUserAge(userID){\n    try {\n      const now = Date.now();\n      const birthdate = this.userDbRepo.getUserBirthdayByID(userID);\n      const years = now.getFullYear() - birthdate.getFullYear();\n      const months = (years * 12) + (now.getMonth() - birthdate.getMonth()) ;\n      const calculatedAge = -1 * (months / 12);\n      \n      return calculatedAge;\n    } catch(e){\n      throw new Error(\"Age not calculated for {\" + e + \"} reason\");\n    }\n  }\n}\nmodule.exports.UserService = UserService;\n\nTo test UserService, you would be required to set up a temporary database, as you cannot connect to dev or even prod databases to run your tests, and the more methods you have the more data you have to put in this local database, not to mention that you have to wait for the database to be up so then your tests can start running. But that's why I said, \"You would\", not you should nor have to. \nUnit Test is one of some test technique levels to guarantee that your code delivers what you intend by breaking it in as small pieces as you can/as possible. It does not matter if your code is divided in functions or classes or modules. You will treat the smallest part of your code as a unit and pretend that anything that piece depends on, is a working piece and ignore it when testing.\nIn our case, classes are our smallest pieces and our dependency is the class UserDBRepo. To \"ignore this dependecy\" in our test and only focus in our code(in this case, calculate the age of the user), we can use a technique called mocking where we will manipulate the class metadata to do what we want instead of connecting to a database, so we can simply return a hardcoded Date object making our tests to be executed fast and save us a lot of time by not worrying about setting up a temp db, configure the tests to connect to this db, put valid data, etc. \nEven though Jest comes with mocking capabilities, I consider them a little \"weak\" for you don't have so many options to mock your objects. To do this, we need another library, one more focused in mocking and one of the most famous in Javascript world nowadays is Sinon. With Sinon you can mock the objects you want to ignore and force their functions to return hardcoded values to you simulating valid scenarios. Let's install it:\nnpm install --save-dev sinon@9.0.2\n\nNow let's see how we mock our UserDBRepo to achieve our age calculation test:\nconst sinon = require(\"sinon\");\n\nconst {UserDBRepo} = require(\"../../../src/javascript/mock_example/user_db_repo.js\");\nconst {UserService} = require(\"../../../src/javascript/mock_example/user_service.js\");\n\nconst userService = new UserService(); // Object to be tested\n\ndescribe('UserService', function() {\n  beforeAll(function(){\n    const mockedNowDate = Date.parse(\"02 May 1989 09:00:00\");\n    sinon.mock(Date).expects(\"now\").returns(new Date(mockedNowDate));\n  });\n  \n  afterEach(function(){\n    //To restore any mock you have done after the test is ran\n    sinon.restore();\n  });\n  describe('#getUserAge(userID)', function() {\n    test('should return 31', function() {\n      //GIVEN\n      const expected = 31;\n      const userID = 5;\n      //Change the behavior of getUserBirthdayByID to return 30 only when the argument is exactly 5\n      const mockedDate = Date.parse(\"02 May 2020 09:00:00\");\n      sinon.mock(UserDBRepo.prototype).expects(\"getUserBirthdayByID\").withExactArgs(5).returns(new Date(mockedDate));\n      //WHEN\n      const actual = userService.getUserAge(userID);      \n      //THEN\n      expect(actual).toEqual(expected);\n    });\n    \n    test('should throw error: \"Age not calculated\"', function() {\n      //GIVEN\n      const expected = new Error(\"Age not calculated for {Error: UserID is invalid or user has no birthdate registered} reason\");\n      const userID = 5;\n      const errorToBeThrown = new Error(\"UserID is invalid or user has no birthdate registered\");\n      //Change the behavior of getUserBirthdayByID to throw an exception only when the argument is exactly 5\n      sinon.mock(UserDBRepo.prototype).expects(\"getUserBirthdayByID\").withExactArgs(5).throws(errorToBeThrown);      \n      //WHEN\n      //THEN\n      expect(() =&gt; userService.getUserAge(userID)).toThrow(expected);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nAnd just like that we ignored everything UserDbRepo.getUserBirthdayByID does and focused on the two cases we have there: When we receive a valid date and when we get an Exception error. This way we asserted that our method UserService.getUserAge is doing what we expect it to do using both Jest and Sinon. \nAnd to prove that mocking can really do as I said, I made this hypothetical example in a working test where I created a useless db lib that not even returns something, mocked user db repo to return a spam of 31 years, like in the above example, created the test exactly as you read and if you want to run it to see the power of mocking please checkout this nodejs_introduction_mock_example branch.\nApplying to our code\nNow going back to our code, as Unit test and mocking were explained, how can we improve our code and test it properly? Let's transform this part \"It is: \" + moment().format();  in a separate class, so our smallest parts will be classes and our /src/app.js will have no code, but will call other classes code. This class, let's call it DateTimeGreetings, depends on moment js library. Moment Js is supposed to be tested already so you do not need to check if it does what you expect it to do, thus ignore it. Create the class /src/javascript/greetings/DateTimeGreetings.js:\nconst moment = require(\"moment\");\n\nclass DateTimeGreetings {\n  greetDateTime(dateFormat){\n    return \"It is: \" + moment().format(dateFormat);\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports.DateTimeGreetings = DateTimeGreetings;\n\nI know it is a simple code, but it is good enough to show unit test in our scenario. Here we have a problem when testing: Time is not constant, because everytime you execute your code it will show you different time, so once you write your test it will be literally \"out-dated\" in the next second and will fail assertion. \nTo fix it, we will use a function named useFakeTimers, that allows us to force moment or any library you might be using(even the native Date library that all browsers have) to always fetch a date and time you provided when checking internally for it. We have to do this instead of use sinon.mock because moment is a function returning an object that has no prototype structure, thus we cannot mock it using normal means. \nThis way we can ignore moment and force it to return what we want, because again, what we want to test is not moment, but our own code, in this case It is: {date-time}. I will again create two tests only, just to ilustrate what I was explaining. Now go to /test/javascript/greetings/, create DateTimeGreetings.test.js and put our tests:\nconst sinon = require(\"sinon\");\nconst {DateTimeGreetings} = require(\"../../../src/javascript/greetings/DateTimeGreetings.js\");\n\ndescribe('DateTimeGreetings', function() {\n  //Create a function that receives a date and lock internal clock to always return this date\n  //to whatever function is fetching date-time\n  const clock = date =&gt; sinon.useFakeTimers(Date.parse(date));\n  const mockdate = \"30 Apr 2020 10:20:00\"\n\n  beforeEach(function(){ // Mocha utility function to run whatever you want before the tests\n    //Execute clock function to lock the date and time to what we want\n    clock(mockdate);\n  })\n  \n  afterEach(function() { // Mocha utility function to run whatever you want after the test\n    //Restore internal clock\n    clock(mockdate).restore();\n  });\n  \n  const dateGreet = new DateTimeGreetings();\n\n  describe('#greetDateTime()', function() {\n    test('should return \"It is: 30-04-2020\"', function() {\n      //GIVEN\n      const format = \"DD-MM-YYYY\";\n      const expected = \"It is: 30-04-2020\";      \n      //WHEN\n      const actual = dateGreet.greetDateTime(format);      \n      //THEN\n      expect(actual).toBe(expected);\n    });\n    \n    test('should return \"It is: 04-30-2020_10:20:00\"', function() {\n      //GIVEN\n      const format = \"MM-DD-YYYY_hh:mm:ss\";\n      const expected = \"It is: 04-30-2020_10:20:00\";      \n      //WHEN\n      const actual = dateGreet.greetDateTime(format);      \n      //THEN\n      expect(actual).toBe(expected);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nNow, instead of using this class directly in /src/app.js we will use it in /src/javascript/greetings/Greetings.js. Let's change our /src/javascript/greetings/Greetings.js file to make /src/javascript/greetings/DateTimeGreetings.js a dependency to demonstrate again how we have to ignore dependencies when testing our \"unit\":\nconst {DateTimeGreetings} = require(\"./DateTimeGreetings.js\");\n\nclass Greetings {\n  constructor(name){\n    this.name = name;\n    this.dateTimeGreeter = new DateTimeGreetings();\n  }\n  \n  greet(){\n    return \"Hello Mr/Ms \" + this.name + \"\\n\" + this.dateTimeGreeter.greetDateTime(\"MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a\");\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports.Greetings = Greetings;\n\nThis time, we will have a different strategy. Instead of manipulating the clock to always returns the same date and time, we will manipulate the class DateTimeGreetings to whenever we execute the method greetDateTime with the given parameter MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a, it should ignore the original code and return to us the following output: \"It is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\". Let's edit our /test/javascript/greetings/Greetings.test.js test suite to see how to do the mock:\nconst sinon = require(\"sinon\"); \nconst {Greetings} = require('../../../src/javascript/greetings/Greetings.js');\nconst {DateTimeGreetings} = require('../../../src/javascript/greetings/DateTimeGreetings.js');\n\nconst greetDev = new Greetings(\"NodeJSDev\");\n\ndescribe(\"Greetings\", function() {\n  beforeEach(function(){\n    sinon\n      .mock(DateTimeGreetings.prototype)\n      .expects(\"greetDateTime\")\n      .withExactArgs(\"MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a\")\n      .returns(\"It is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\");\n  });\n  \n  afterEach(function(){\n    //This is to restore all your mocks to original code\n    //As you can mock things directly in the test in case you need, as I did in our db example\n    sinon.restore();\n  });\n  \n  describe('#greet()', function() {\n    test(`should return \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJSDev\\\\nIt is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\"`, function() {\n      //GIVEN\n      const expected = \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJSDev\\nIt is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\";      \n      //WHEN\n      const actual = greetDev.greet();\n      //THEN\n      expect(actual).toEqual(expected);\n    });\n    \n    test(`should not return \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJSDev \\\\nIt is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\"`, function() {\n      //GIVEN\n      const expected = \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJSDev \\nIt is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\";      \n      //WHEN\n      const actual = greetDev.greet();\n      //THEN\n      expect(actual).not.toEqual(expected);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nAnd now run the tests again and you should see this: \n\nJust o be clear, all these \"rules\" I said are for Unit Testing and Unit Testing is 1(one) of many tests types. There is a specific type of test named Integration Test that you have to fake a database for example or a backend server for ajax tests or even an HTTP engine to see if your code pieces integrate well and deliver what is expected as a whole. But, I will leave it for another post focused in testing only.\nAnd now change /src/app.js:\nconst {Greetings} = require(\"./javascript/greetings/Greetings.js\");\n\nconst greetDev = new Greetings(\"Node Dev\");\n\nconsole.log(greetDev.greet());\n\nRun your app and see what it has become:\n\nConclusion\nIn this post we learned the basic of the basic about creating a Node JS app with simple and more complex tests. For now it is a simple CLI app but, from here we can evolve it easily to a complex frontend or even backend app. If you want to see the complete code, please, clone the bitbucket repository for this post and checkout branch nodejs_introduction.

So we can have a kind of a journal of what we learned and how we learned for future guidance.\nWhat is Portfel Projet ?\nPortfel is a polish word that means 'wallet'. The idea is to create a simple virtual wallet where you can manage your money like create virtual wallets, deposit and withdraw money on them, borrow money to and from others users and have a simple frontend. Everything using a micro-service like application.\nFirst meeting\nIn the first meeting we created a Github repository for the application(this will be public available in the future) and had our ideas of what we want the application should do in a broader view\n\nIt was decided that our application will have a User Management service on it's own(something like an OAuth service).\n\n\nThis is will be a simple service to authenticate and authorize the user so he/she can wander through the application\n\n\nThe wallet management service will allow the user to deposit and withdraw money, as borrow and ask money\n\n\nThe service that will actually do the actions, where the user can create your wallets deposit and withdraw money and borrow to and from others users\n\nWe also added a future idea of adding some or all wallets in a blockchain to make things more serious like using it's smart contracts and other things, but so far it's just an idea, nothing concrete\nConclusion\nI know this is but a very short description about the projet and as it was just the first meeting. We will work on adding more and more ideas in the next time until we have something usefull we can start with to either code or just develop documentation on top of it. So see you in the next post. If you want to know what's my friend view about this meeting reach him in his blog using this link(Whenever he posts it I will update it here)\n","id":"https://kiberstender.github.io/project-portfel-first-meeting/","title":"Portfel project- First meeting"},"https://kiberstender.github.io/project-portfel-second-meeting/":{"body":"Introduction\nHello again my dear reader, this is the 'Log' of the second meeting about Portfel project, where me and my friend Cesar discussed with a little more details what we want or not want our application to do. If you did not read the first meeting post, please read it here before you start this one. \nIn this meeting we simply discussed a little more what we already discussed in the first meeting, so as a small spoiler we detailed how the 'User Management Service' will work and how it will interact with 'Wallet Management Service' and so on and so forth. To finish this introduction spoilers we discussed a bit further how we imagine will be the sctructure of the application as a whole. So stay tunned (90's called the expression back) and let's go to the point.\nThe whole structure\nIt was defined that the application will be composed by a series of Docker images orchestrated by a Docker Compose application. All services (except database/service communication and frontend/backend communcation) will communicate between each other using Kafka, because then we can manage the requests without losing any of them in case we have way more requests that we can process. \nKafka will be discussed with more details when I post the meeting about creating a Kafka docker image for our application, but, in short, Kafka is a queue application and as a queue in real life we will have one application in one side of this queue, queueing requests and in the other side one application dequeueing these requests and processing them so when it finishes the response, the application will queue it in another queue to be dequeued by another application waiting in the other end.\nBesides Kafka image we will have the following docker images in this application:\n\nWeb front-end image\nUser database image\nWallet database image\nUser management back-end service image\nWallet management back-end service image\nA REST service to connect the front-end and back-end image\nThe already quoted Kafka image\n\nUser Management Service\nThis service will manages user authentication and authorization and it will composed by 3 parts:\n\nA MongoDB Database for storing the user data(which we haven't decided yet what data we will store)\nA Backend application written in Scala to manage the authorization and the authentication\nA Front-end application for logging in actions written using Webpack, (Angular or React) and Scss\n\nThis is to be written as an OAuth service so it shall work granting access to certain areas based on an user role, the sessions will expiry after X hours and most important it should be secure so nobody(it includes us the developers and whoever is working in other IT areas in the 'company') besides the user will have access to their data.\nConclusion\nAnother short meeting with few new details added. Believe it or not it took us almost 3 hours to define these changes and in the end we simply defined that we will have at least 7 Docker images being controlled by Docker Composer. As always, as soon as my friend post his post in his blog about this meeting I'll update this post here and put the link to you so you can have a different perspective about the project. See you in the next post, bye.\n","id":"https://kiberstender.github.io/project-portfel-second-meeting/","title":"Portfel project- Second meeting"},"https://kiberstender.github.io/webpack-frontend/":{"body":"Introduction\nThe previous post (Webpack- A complete introduction) has introduced the basics of Webpack, but it constrained all that was done to be a CLI(Command Line Interface) application, while Webpack is more focused on frontend applications. So, in this post I will show you what is necessary to instead of print in the console, render the data into an HTML page. \nI will continue the development of the Javascript project I was working with on the previous post, so, if you did not read it, please consider doing it before starting this post or if you prefer, you can clone the project and checkout the post's branch:\ngit clone https://bitbucket.org/kiberStender/node_app.git\ncd node_app/\ngit checkout --track origin/webpack_introduction\n\nI won't be explaining what is already explained in the other post and I will assume you are already familiarized with Javascript, NodeJS and the basic of Webpack.\nHTML-Loader and HTMLWebpackPlugin\nWell, all that was done in the previous post is cool and nice but, the idea of this tutorial is to create a frontend and not a CLI app. In order to do that, we have to deal with HTML files. But... what is it there to deal with? HTML is a so simple \"language*\", why would you need to handle it? For now we only have one Javascript file(main.js), but as the application grows, the best practices ask us to split it in as many files as we can/need and because Javascript is an interpreted language, if you forget to include some file (&lt;script src=\".../path\"&gt;), you won't notice it until it is too late. So we have an automated way to add automatically all Javascript and CSS files, to never forget them. To achieve this, we have the HtmlWebpackPlugin. To configure this plugin, we first add it via npm install ...:\nnpm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin@4.2.0\n\nPS: In order to make it work even years after this post is written, use the same version of the libraries I'm using.\nNow you have to add /webpack.config.js \"import\" HTMLWebpackPlugin before module.exports = {...:\n...\nconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require(\"html-webpack-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n...\n\nPS: Whenever you see three dots ... it means: \"keep whatever comes before this\". Or if it comes after what we are adding/modifying, it means: \"keep whatever comes after these dots\"\nNow configure it in plugins property and tell which HTML file you want to operate:\n...\nplugins: [\n  ...\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({template: \"./src/index.html\"}),\n  ...\n]\n...\n\nPS: You can specify more than one HTML file but remember that Webpack is more indicated for SPA(Single Page Application)\nIf you run it, you'll notice that you have 2(two) problems: \n\nThere is no HTML file yet\nWebpack will complain that it needs a loader for HTML files\n\nSo first let's fix the missing HTML file. Create the HTML file named index.html inside /src. Now add the contents:\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;Getting Started&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;div id=\"root\"&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nNow we add a loader for HTML files. Simply install html-loader:\nnpm install --save-dev html-loader@1.1.0\n\nYou could run now, but it would still not work, because we haven't configured html-loader, so let's do it:\n...\nrules: [\n  ...\n  {\n    test: /\\.(html|htm)$/,\n    use: {\n      loader: \"html-loader\"\n    }\n  },\n  ...\n]\n...\n\nIf you run now, this is what you are supposed to see:\n\nIf you pay attention to our HTML file, there is no &lt;script&gt; tag there, but if you open /dist/index.html file you can see that there is a &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"main.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; including main.js. The loader is not there only to help the plugin to work, it can tweak the HTML removing all blank spaces and the comments, making it lighter to transfer. Simply add the following values in options property :\n...\n{\n  test: /\\.(html|htm)$/,\n  use: {\n    loader: 'html-loader',\n    options: {\n      // Disables tags and attributes processing\n      minimize: true\n    }\n  }\n}\n...\nHot-Reload or Live-Reload\nWebpack is made to help you create static frontend pages. That means, no server(JSF, PHP, etc) will pre process your HTML pages before sending to the user. Every processing to change data in the screen is made by your javascript and css files locally on the user browser, thus decreasing backend number of requisitions. But to test your application in your browser, you have to every time you change something, go to your browser and manually CTRL + F5. If you have two monitor and keep your code open in one and the browser in the other, it is very annoying to change the monitor every time to refresh your page and check if what you did is correct. Hot-Reload or Live-Reload is a feature that helps you detecting all changes you do in your code and automatically reload your running application. First install webpack-dev-server:\nnpm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server@3.10.3\n\nIt is a simple server to run your application in Hot/Live-reload mode, so whenever you save a file, Webpack will detect if there is any difference and if so, recompile only that file so you don't have to stop the whole application for one diff. PS: Hot/Live-Reload is just for development purpouses, DO NOT USE IT IN PRODUCTION. It is slow and it does not uglify your code making it easier for non-authorized people to read or debug it.\nLet's create our hot-reload command. Open /package.json and in the scripts property and add these lines:\n...\n\"scripts\": {\n  ...\n  \"live\": \"webpack-dev-server --mode development\",\n  \"live:prod\": \"webpack-dev-server --mode production\",\n  ...\n}\n...\n\nAnd that's it, no configuration is needed. Run it and you will see this:\n\nGo to http://localhost:8080 and see your page opened with a simple Title: Getting started and the rest of the page white. Let's put some action in it. Change /src/index.js file content to:\nimport Person from \"person/Person\";\nimport Greetings from \"greetings/Greetings\";\n\nfunction buildGreetElement(){\n  const greetElement = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  const person = new Person(\"Node\", \"Dev\");\n  let greetings = new Greetings(person);\n  greetElement.innerHTML = greetings.greet();\n  \n  return greetElement;\n}\n\nfunction component() {\n  const mainDiv = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  \n  mainDiv.appendChild(buildGreetElement());\n\n  return mainDiv;\n}\n\ndocument.querySelector(\"#root\").appendChild(component());\n\nWithout stoping the application, check your terminal after you save /src/index.js and you will see Webpack recompiling/transpiling your changed files (in this case /src/index.js only), now go to your browser and without pressing anything the white page will show you the below picture:\n\nYou can see that \\n does not \"jump\" a line here right? So let's make it more frontend. First open /src/javascript/greetings/DateTimeGreetings,js and make it return an HTML element, so change the function greetDateTime to:\n...\ngreetDateTime(dateFormat){\n  const mainDiv = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  mainDiv.setAttribute(\"id\", \"date-time-greetings-component\");\n  mainDiv.append(`It is: ${moment().format(dateFormat)}`);\n  \n  return mainDiv;\n}\n...\n\nNow open your /src/javascript/greetings/Greetings,js and do the same with the function greet:\n...\ngreet(){\n  const mainDiv = document.createElement(\"div\"); //The main div that will hold everything\n  mainDiv.setAttribute(\"id\", \"greetings-component\");\n    \n  const {name, surname} = this.person;\n    \n  mainDiv.append(`Hello Mr/Ms ${name} ${surname}`); // Adding the greet to be displayed\n  // greetDateTime already returns an HTML element\n  mainDiv.appendChild(this.dateTimeGreeter.greetDateTime(\"MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a\"));\n    \n  return mainDiv;\n}\n...\n\nNow open /src/index.js and change it one last time:\nimport Person from \"person/Person\";\nimport Greetings from \"greetings/Greetings\";\n\nfunction component() {\n  const mainDiv = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  mainDiv.setAttribute(\"id\", \"greetings-example\");\n  const person = new Person(\"Node\", \"Dev\");\n  let greetings = new Greetings(person);\n  \n  mainDiv.appendChild(greetings.greet());\n\n  return mainDiv;\n}\n\ndocument.querySelector(\"#root\").appendChild(component());\n\nNow it should be like that:\n\nAnd the HTML source:\n\nHashing your files\nOnce the application officially became a Frontend app, it might have an annoying problem that has started to be dealt with when adding clean-webpack-plugin. But, back then, cache was a problem at development level and as I  mentioned, it is awesome to have a cache at production level, because it speeds up the app. Modern Browsers when they detect by file name that it was already downloaded, they do not need to download it again in case the page is refreshed, thus decrease the amount of bandwith required to load the page and make it faster to render.\nThis is beautiful once your page is done and in production, but when you are developing, it can create old annoying caches that does not refresh. To prevent that you can use hashing names in your files provided by Webpack for free. Webpack will hash your whole files at build level and generate a hash string, so everytime you recompile the file, if there is a difference, this hash value will be different and browsers will never cache something that changed the name. To do so, it is very easy, just append [hash] to whatever part of your output file name you want inside /webpack.config.js:\n...\noutput: {\n  filename: \"main.[hash].js\",\n  path: ...\n},\n...\n\nNow putting everything together: The clean plugin will always delete the content of /dist directory, hashing will always create new name for your files as you do changes on them, then HTML loader will always include them in your page to you, so you never forget any javascript file. Now you can only focus on coding your app without being affraid of having old stuff in your cache or issues because some new file was not added to you page. This is what you will see after npm run-script build or npm run-script build:prod:\n\nWhat about CSS?\nAs Javascript has many transpilers (Typescript, Coffescript, Javascript itself in different versions) in CSS there are 2(two) main transpilers(called Pre processors): LESS and SASS. In this tutorial I will use SASS, because I'm going to use Boostrap and it is built using SASS, then by using both together, you can use Bootstrap pre-defined functions and other things specific to SASS. If you, for some reason, don't want to use SASS, but still want to use Bootstrap, don't worry, it is still possible, but you will have to compile Bootstrap to CSS and then call it in your LESS or pure CSS files without any problem. So let's start configuring SASS installing all the dependencies:\nnpm install --save-dev sass@1.26.5 sass-loader@8.0.2 style-loader@1.2.0 css-loader@3.5.3\n\nNow we go to our /webpack.config.js file and add a new rule in our module property, like it was done for Babel and HTML-loader:\n...\n{\n  test: /\\.s[ac]ss|css$/i,\n  use: [\"style-loader\", \"css-loader\", \"sass-loader\"]\n}\n...\n\n\nNow create a styles directory inside /src to store the SASS files and add it to our path resolution in the Webpack config file:\n...\nresolve: {\n  modules: [path.resolve(__dirname, \"src/javascript\"), path.resolve(__dirname, \"src/styles\"), \"node_modules\"]\n}\n...\n\nNow do the same in /jest.config.js:\nmodule.exports = {\n  \"moduleDirectories\":[\"src/javascript\", \"src/styles\", \"node_modules\"]\n}\n\nPS: As node_modules can be a huge directory to look for, I like to leave it at the end of the array of modules, so Webpack/Jest will always look into our modules before anything else, but, I have to say here that I'm not 100% sure it obeys the order you declare things.\nAnd that is all you need to do to have SASS in the project. A small mention here, to the test property, where the value is this: s[ac]ss. This is due to SASS having 2(two) main file formats: .sass and .scss. Both means the same, if you want to understand more about it read it here. One day I might do a tutorial focused in SASS and explain these differences in the file formats. Now to test if everything worked you can create a file index.scss in your /src/styles directory and put the following:\n$a_color: red; //A variable\n\n#greetings-example {\n  color: $a_color; //Using the variable\n}\n\nGo to /src/index.js file and import /src/styles/index.scss:\n...\nimport Greetings from \"greetings/Greetings\";\nimport \"index.scss\";\n...\n\nYes, for CSS, SASS or LESS files, when importing them, there is no need for adding \"from\" keyword. Keep the rest as it was. Now if you haven't stopped the application, restart it or run it otherwise(npm run-script live). If your text now is red, congratulations, you succeded in adding SASS pre proprocessor in your app:\n\nBootstrap\nBootstrap is one of the most famous CSS libraries used nowadays. It is very simple to use and have a big community for you to ask your questions. I could use any library here, but I decided to put this one for it is very known and easy to add. To have Bootstrap simply install the dependencies: \nnpm install bootstrap@4.4.1 jquery@3.5.0\n\njQuery is here because Bootstrap needs this library to work, I will not use jQuery for anything in this tutorial. Now to test if this worked, add the following changes to /src/styles/index.scss file:\n@import '~bootstrap';\n\n#greetings-example {\n  @extend .container;\n  @extend .text-primary;\n}\n\nLook again at your page(if you haven't stopped your application, otherwise run it again) and if the color is now blue, you did it, you have a fully working frontend application made with Webpack, Babel, SASS and Bootstrap.\n\nDifferent CSS rules for each class\nA simple CSS good pratices rule here. The reason I put an ID in each mainDiv inside each class of the project, is to separate scope when using CSS. So using Webpack will allow you to create a different file for each \"component\" in the project making it easier to create a CSS(or in this case SASS) file dedicated for each class so we to not mix the concerns. To show that, I will create a new file named /src/javascript/App.js that will be the entry point of the application leaving /src/index.js to just start the application and nothing more, like a main method in Java/C/C++.\nimport Person from \"person/Person\";\nimport Greetings from \"greetings/Greetings\";\n\nimport \"app.scss\";\n\nexport default class App {\n  buildTitle(){\n    const h2Element = document.createElement(\"h1\");\n    h2Element.append(\"Greetings Example\");\n  \n    return h2Element;\n  }\n  \n  buildGreetings(){\n    const person = new Person(\"Node\", \"Dev\");\n    return new Greetings(person);\n  }\n\n  build(){\n    const mainDiv = document.createElement(\"div\");\n    mainDiv.setAttribute(\"id\", \"greetings-example\");\n\n    mainDiv.appendChild(this.buildTitle());  \n    mainDiv.appendChild(this.buildGreetings().greet());\n\n    return mainDiv;\n  }\n}\n\nNotice that I imported app.scss and not index.scss. I'm not creating a new file, I will renamed /src/styles/index.scss to /src/styles/app.scss and keep the rest:\nmv src/styles/index.scss src/styles/app.scss\n\nThen edit /src/index.js:\nimport App from \"App.js\"\n\ndocument.querySelector(\"#root\").appendChild(new App().build());\n\nAnd this is how it should be now:\n\nNow create a directory named greetings inside /src/styles/ and create a file inside it(/src/styles/greetings/) named dateTimeGreetings.scss and add the following content:\n#date-time-greetings-component {\n  color: green;\n}\n\nNow import it into file /src/javascrit/greetings/DateTimeGreetings.js:\nimport moment from \"moment\";\n\nimport \"greetings/dateTimeGreetings.scss\";\n...\n...\n\nPS: Notice that because /src/styles was added to path resolution it is possible to use the same url style for css/sass imports\nNow the page should be like this:\n\nNow create a greetings.scss file inside /src/styles/greetings/ and add:\n#greetings-component {\n  color: black;\n}\n\nImport it into the /src/javascrit/greetings/Greetings.js:\n...\nimport Person from \"person/Person\";\n\nimport \"greetings/greetings.scss\";\n...\n...\n\nAnd this is the final result:\n\nEven tough it looks silly, this is to show that, you now can have all your files completely segregated from each other and the result is a clean final code, without coupling and not hard to manage because of the way Webpack helps us.\nServe\nWhen explaining about Hot/Live-reload, I mention that you should never use it in production, because it does not optmize your code making it slow and does not uglify it allowing other people to easily read and debug it or even copy what you did. But I also said that Webpack is for making static frontend, so how one is supposed to run this app in production? Some servers like github static server will simply serve your app without any config, you just copy everything from your /dist and commit. But when you don't have such server and you have to make your own, how do you do it? There is a CLI app named serve that does that for you. To install simply run the command:\nnpm install --save-dev serve@11.3.0\n\nThen change execute script in /package.json to:\n...\n\"scripts\":{\n  ...\n  \"serve\":\"serve -s dist\",\n  \"execute\":\"npm run-script build:prod &amp;&amp; npm run-script serve\",\n  ...\n}\n...\n\nIn case you want to serve, but choose if you will build in dev or mode prod I created a simple serve command and I edited execute to be your deploy command so it will always build in prod mod and then serve it. \"dist\" in the serve -s dist is the name of the directory you want to serve, so if you configured your Webpack to output your files to another place, please change it accordingly. And to run simply execute:\nnpm run-script execute\n\nAnd now check http://localhost:5000. Unlike Hot-Reload, every change you do is completely ignored, because it is statically serving what is in your /dist. But of course if you trigger build from another terminal, as serve blocks the actual terminal you are using, and then hit F5 or CTRL + F5 or even the refresh button your changes will be displayed, but this, of course, kills the whole idea of statically serving the application as this is your production application deployed.\nSize problem\nNow that the application is a frontend instead of a CLI, in order to make it succeed, it has to perform well. It means, after the user typed the url in their browser, the application has to load fast. One problem it has right now is it's size: It weighs more than 400 KiB:\n\nWebpack recommends that the maximum size it can have is 244 KiB. This being said what, should be done? First, find out what is the cause of this huge size. In this case, the problem is in MomentJS. It is being loaded as whole in the application while it is being used very little of it. How to fix it? MomentJS provides a plugin named moment-locales-webpack-plugin, which can help removing the locales not needed in the application. Install it:\nnpm install --save-dev moment-locales-webpack-plugin@1.2.0\n\nNow, configure it in the file /webpack.config.js:\n...\nconst MomentLocalesPlugin = require('moment-locales-webpack-plugin');\n...\n\nIn the plugin section, still in /webpack.config.js, instantiate the new plugin:\n...\nplugins:[\n   ...,\n   new MomentLocalesPlugin(),\n   ...\n]\n...\n\nBy default, if one use new MomentLocalesPlugin(), the plugin will understand that only en locale has to be kept, but if you want to add another locale just pass an object to the constructor:\n...\nnew MomentLocalesPlugin({localesToKeep: ['ru']}), //Russian Locale\n...\n\nThis way the plugin will keep two locales: en and ru. Run build:prod command and see that the application is smaller than 244 KiB:\n\nSeparation of environments\nWhen making a more professional application, usually, you have to separate what you use in development and what you use in production, to not have for example faulty data in production or let the application startup be slow in development, because you want to use all optimizations you do in production. For this and other small issues it is needed to separate options for the app configuration. \nAs I have probably mentioned more than 3(three) times in this series of posts, Webpack has support for it, both automatic and manual control over the environments. As our application is very simple and small I will use two very simple use cases:\n\ndev-tool: In the very beginning I set a property in webpack.config.js named devtool to source-map. This is really nice to help your browser to know more about your application as it is loading and interpreting, so it can apply some more optimizations at \"bare metal\" level. But a source-map, is a very detailed metadata about your functions, classes, modules, etc, so the bigger your code base is, the bigger the time to make source-map. Not that it will take 1 hour, but when you are developing something new or fixing a bug, any second extra it takes to the application to start running for you to see if you fixed or not is annoying. So what if you could turn off source-map when in dev mode and leave it to be done only when you are deploying to your production server?\nhtml-loader: When I was showing in this post what html-loader can do to decrease the size of the HTML files by removing blank spaces and comments it was very cool, but in dev environment sometimes having these comments and the identation can help reading the code so it would be better if we have this tunning in production only.\n\nTo do so there are at least 3(three) possibilites and I will go deeper in only 1, but it is worthy to know all of them:\n\nHave more than one webpack.config.file: You can have as many as you want and each one can be for a specific enviroment. To switch them you only have to pass it in package.json scripts command. For example, there are 2(two) build commands(build and build:prod), what if there were 2(two) Webpack config file like: webpack.dev.config.js and webpack.prod.config.js, scripts could be changed to be like that:...\n  \"build\":\"webpack --config webpack.dev.config.js\",\n  \"build:prod\":\"webpack --config webpack.prod.config.js\"\n...\nThen in the respectives Webpack config files, it can set a new property named mode to either development or environment, so whenever the build commands are ran, it will not be displayed the warning about environment fallback.\nCroos-env library: When running the app in different Operational Systems, the way the environmental variable is passed in command line can differ and might be a problem. So installing this lib can help you as it will fix any difference to you and you an write only once your package.json script commands and pass values without incompatibility. Then you can pass an env variable setting your webpack to Prod or Dev and change mode property accordingly and you can use ternary expressions to assign values to the properties inside webpack.config.file.\nChange webpack.config.file from a object literal to a function that returns the object literal: This function has two parameters and the second of them has the mode value set in the package.json build command: The --mode development or --mode production. This way we can use ternary expressions to assign values to all properties inside webpack.config.js file.\n\nThe easier way to me(not the best) is the third way. Because it does not require creating additional files, nor changing package.json nor adding any libraries. Again, it is the easier, not the best.\nOriginal:\n...\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry:...,\n  output:...,\n  devtool:...,\n  plugins:...,\n  module:...,\n  resolve:...\n};\n\nWhat has to be done:\n...\nmodule.exports = function(nv, options) {\n  const isProd = options.mode === \"production\";\n  \n  return {\n    entry:...,\n    output:...,\n    devtool:...,\n    plugins:...,\n    module:...,\n    resolve:...\n  };\n}\n\nNow the ternary expression can be used to dynamically assign values according to the environment to whatever desired property, like for example, change devtool:\n...\ndevtool: isProd ? \"source-map\" : \"eval\",\n...\n\nAnd in html-loader:\n{\n  test: /\\.(html|htm)$/,\n  use: {\n    loader: 'html-loader',\n    options: {\n      minimize: isProd\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNow run npm run-script build and check /dist. You will notice that there is no map file anymore and if you check index.html it has all the spaces and identation.\nBackend serve\nIf you use some backend framework like Spring, you can simply compile/transpile everything to /src/main/resources/static or if you use Play Framework compile/transpile everything to /public when in production mode. Or to be more generic, compile/transpile everything from /dist to the the directory dedicated for static files in your backend engine/framework when in prod mode.\nImagine you have a directory named webapp in the root of you Spring app, and everything that was done in this whole tutorial is inside /webapp, so webpack.config.js is not in the root, then you have to adjust your output:\n...\noutput: {\n  filename: \"main.[hash].js\",\n  path: path.resolve(__dirname, isProd ? \"../src/main/resources/static\" : \"dist\")\n},\n...\n\nFor Playframerwork it is the same, it has to go back one level(if you use the same webapp structure) to put everything in /public directory:\n...\noutput: {\n  filename: \"main.[hash].js\",\n  path: path.resolve(__dirname, isProd ? \"../public: : \"dist\")\n},\n...\n\nIf this is your reality, ignore installation of serve and change where output.path in webpack.config.js puts the content after npm run-script build:prod.\nTesting your frontend\nAnd here we are again, changing the tests to reflect the new code. If you try to run them right now you will see that they are broken because Jest cannot recognize the Sass syntax when importing our .scss files:\n\nTo fix that, it is needed to tell Jest to whatever non-Javascript file imported, to change it's code to a dummy empty object ({}). So a stub file is created for all CSS/SASS/LESS files that might be imported in the code. Go to /test/ and create a new directory named jest_stub, now inside this new directory create a file named CssStub.js and put the following content:\nmodule.exports = {};\n\nNow open /jest.config.js and add a new property named moduleNameMapper with the following value:\nmodule.exports = {\n  \"moduleDirectories\": ...,\n  \"moduleNameMapper\": {\n    \"^.+\\\\.(css|scss|less)$\": \"&lt;rootDir&gt;/test/jest_stub/CssStub.js\",\n  }\n}\n\nNow if you run the tests again the import problem is no more and we now there are problems because the suite tests were expecting the classes to return Strings but they are returning HTML Node objects now:\n\nNow to fix that it is needed to use HTML Node method innerHTML in the expected function. Let's first fix /test/javascript/greetings/DateTimeGreetings.test.js as this is the easiest test suite:\n...\ntest('should return \"It is: 30-04-2020\"', function() {\n  ...\n  //THEN\n  expect(actual.innerHTML).toBe(expected);\n});\n    \ntest('should return \"It is: 04-30-2020_10:20:00\"', function() {\n  ...\n  //THEN\n  expect(actual.innerHTML).toBe(expected);\n});\n...\n\nNow /test/javascript/greetings/Greetings.test.js is going to be fixed. As this suite test has to mock DateTimeGreetings class, it cannot force it to return a String. Even though I said that when mocking you can force the class to return anything you want, one might not change the original type that the function that is being mocked returns. This is because, for example, mainDiv.appendChild does not accept String as a parameter, so it has to create an HTML Node instance to use in sinon.mock(...)returns:\n...\nconst dateTimeGreetNode = document.createElement(\"div\");\ndateTimeGreetNode.setAttribute(\"id\", \"date-time-greetings-component\");\ndateTimeGreetNode.append(\"It is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\");\n  \nbeforeEach(function(){\n\n  sinon\n    .mock(DateTimeGreetings.prototype)\n    .expects(\"greetDateTime\")\n    .withExactArgs(\"MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a\")\n    .returns(dateTimeGreetNode);\n});\n...\n\ntest(`should return \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJS Dev\\\\nIt is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\"`, function() {\n  //GIVEN\n  const expected = `Hello Mr/Ms NodeJS Dev&lt;div id=\"date-time-greetings-component\"&gt;It is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm&lt;/div&gt;`;\n  //WHEN\n  const actual = greetDev.greet();\n  //THEN\n  expect(actual.innerHTML).toBe(expected);\n});\n    \ntest(`should not return \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJS Dev \\\\nIt is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\"`, function() {\n  //GIVEN\n  const expected = `Hello Mr/Ms NodeJS Dev&amp;nbsp;&lt;div id=\"date-time-greetings-component\"&gt;It is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm&lt;/div&gt;`;\n  //WHEN\n  const actual = greetDev.greet();\n  //THEN\n  expect(actual.innerHTML).not.toBe(expected);\n});\n...\n\nNow create a test for the new class /src/javascript/App.js in /test/javascript/App.test.js. This test will mock Greetings class:\nimport sinon from \"sinon\";\nimport Greetings from \"greetings/Greetings\";\nimport App from \"App\"\n\nconst app = new App();\n\ndescribe(\"App\", function() {\n  const dateTimeGreetNode = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  dateTimeGreetNode.setAttribute(\"id\", \"date-time-greetings-component\");\n  dateTimeGreetNode.append(\"It is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\");\n  const greetingsNode = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  greetingsNode.setAttribute(\"id\", \"greetings-component\");\n  greetingsNode.append(\"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJS Dev\");\n  greetingsNode.appendChild(dateTimeGreetNode);  \n  \n  beforeEach(function(){\n    sinon\n      .mock(Greetings.prototype)\n      .expects(\"greet\")\n      .returns(greetingsNode);\n  });\n  \n  afterEach(function(){\n    sinon.restore();\n  });\n  \n  describe('#build()', function() {\n    test(`should return \"Greetings Example\\\\nGreetings Hello Mr/Ms NodeJS Dev\\\\nIt is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\"`, function() {\n      //GIVEN\n      const expected = `&lt;h1&gt;Greetings Example&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div id=\\\"greetings-component\\\"&gt;Hello Mr/Ms NodeJS Dev&lt;div id=\\\"date-time-greetings-component\\\"&gt;It is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`;\n      //WHEN\n      const actual = app.build();\n      //THEN\n      expect(actual.innerHTML).toBe(expected);\n    });\n    \n    test(`should not return \"Greetings Example\\\\nHello Mr/Ms NodeJS Dev \\\\nIt is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\"`, function() {\n      //GIVEN\n      const expected = `&lt;h1&gt;Greetings Example&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div id=\\\"greetings-component\\\"&gt;Hello Mr/Ms NodeJS Dev&amp;nbsp;&lt;div id=\\\"date-time-greetings-component\\\"&gt;It is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`;\n      //WHEN\n      const actual = app.build();\n      //THEN\n      expect(actual.innerHTML).not.toBe(expected);\n    });\n  });\n});\n\n\nIt is done, the tests are fixed and now if you run all of them, they should pass. But there is still something missing... Something to show that it is really right. An integration test is needed to see if the HTML in a browser is really modified to what we expect it to be modified. As for now it is only checked what the functions return but that do not necessarily means that it would work in a real browser. So how to check it? Jest comes bundled with a library named JSDom. This library fakes a web browser so it can be used on the tests to check if a button was fired, if this fire button action changed something expected to change, if changed it correctly, and so on and so forth.\nSo we are going to create our first Integration Test. We will only fake the date because of the problem with date and time being constant and let the rest happen automatically without mocking anything and then check if our root ID div has changed accordingly. First create the file /test/javascript/AppIntegration.test.js and add the following content:\nimport sinon from \"sinon\";\n\ndescribe(\"AppIntegrationTest\", function() {  \n  const clock = date =&gt; sinon.useFakeTimers(Date.parse(date));\n  const mockdate = \"30 Apr 2020 10:20:00\"\n\n  beforeEach(function(){\n    clock(mockdate);\n  });\n  \n  afterEach(function() {\n    clock(mockdate).restore();\n  });\n  \n  test(\"Check integration of all parts\", function(){\n    //GIVEN\n    document.body.innerHTML = `&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div id=\"root\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;`;\n    const expected = `&lt;div id=\"greetings-example\"&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Greetings Example&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;div id=\"greetings-component\"&gt;Hello Mr/Ms Node Dev&lt;div id=\"date-time-greetings-component\"&gt;It is: April 30th 2020, 10:20:00 am&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`;\n    \n    //WHEN\n    require(\"../../src/index.js\");\n    \n    //THEN\n    expect(document.querySelector(\"#root\").innerHTML).toBe(expected);\n  });\n});\n\nAnd voi la, a working integration test. As I said nothing was mocked but the date time in our system, otherwise, this test would fail even before the first run as the time that would put in the expected constant would be different 1ms later. Now run and see the result:\n\n* Don't you ever say HTML is a language in an interview. EVER!\nConclusion\nIn this post we learned how Webpack works to make static frontend application. We added SASS, Boostrap, we hashed our js files to take proper advantage of browser cache mechanism, we learned how to control the environment, we improved our tests again and added a new Integration test.

They are called task runners, for they do exactly what the title suggests: run tasks ... over your files, transforming them from one language to another (Typescript -&gt; Javascript), checking if your syntax is correct(Applying JSLint) or even making your production code ugly so it will be hard for people to copy what you have done(Uglifying your code). The most famous ones you will find in the market are: Grunt, Gulp and Webppack.\nThis post will focus on introducing Webpack. I will continue the development of a simple Javascript project I started on another post (NodeJS- A very simple introduction), so if you did not read it, please consider doing it before starting this post or if you prefer you can clone the project and go to the branch specific for the post:\ngit clone https://bitbucket.org/kiberStender/node_app.git\ncd node_app/\ngit checkout --track origin/nodejs_introduction\n\nI won't be explaining what is already explained in the other post and I will assume you are already familiarized with Javascript and NodeJS.\nWebpack\nThis application is, as the name suggests, focused on packing things or as they claim in their web page: to bundle things. As your frontend is growing you will see yourself with the decision of having huge files to easy manage scope in your HTML pages(which is bad, for being hard not to couple things as they are in the same file) or a lot of small files and problems to add them in the correct order or even to remember to add them in your HTML page. So Webpack comes to help us offering solutions to manage your project, allowing you to keep using small decoupled files and packing them in a single file in the end making it easier to include in your HTML page. And this is not the only possibility, as Webpack can help you producing small bundles, in case your \"single file\" is bigger than 244 Kib, making it easier for browsers to download them in parallel chuncks speeding the loading of your page. These feature are the ones Webpack does \"for free\" to you, but there are other features you can add, extending Webpack functionalities using Loaders and Plugins.\nHow does it work?\nWhile NPM is like Maven for Node, you can list and download your dependencies, Webpack is where you tell what to do with these dependencies. When you are listing devDependencies in your package.json, these are (mostly) CLI(Command Line Interface) applications, that means, applications that run in your terminal/prompt cmd and these in particular, you use to do some transformation in your code, like writing everything in Typescript and then converting to Javascript. While you could do it manually by installing Typescript compiler like you would do with Java compiler, Webpack lets you create functions to act on your code, like you would do in automated way. Webpack also has a production/development mode where it does some default things for you, like uglify your code automatically when in Prod mode or minify it removing unnecessary blank spaces.\nInstalling and configuring\nTo guarantee that this post will not fail in the future, install everything in the same version I will put here:\nnpm install --save-dev webpack@4.43.0 webpack-cli@3.3.11\n\nCheck your package.json file. NPM added new devDependency for you and it should contain new libraries:\n\nExplaning the libs we just installed we have:\n\nWebpack: API to use inside your Node application to help customising builds. So if you want to create your own way of building or bundling your application, you can use this library to speed up your process allowing you to focus on things that Webpack might not have\nWebpack-cli: CLI app that does the same thing Webpack does but you don't need to import Webpack in your application, you can 'pass' your application as a parameter to Webpack-Cli and the rest is Webpack lib work\n\nWebpack has a default behaviour that, when you run it, it will look for a file named index.js in the /src directory and create a new file named main.js and put it inside a directory named dist in the root of your application. For this reason, we're going to change our /src/app.js to /src/index.js. Now add a new scripts command named build in your package.json:\n...\n\"scripts\": {\n  ...\n  \"build\": \"webpack\",\n  ...\n}\n...\n\nPS: Whenever you see three dots ... it means \"keep whatever comes before this\" or if it comes after what we are adding/modifying, it means \"keep whatever comes after these dots\"\nNow execute your script and you should see something similar to this:\n\nThe warnings\nWe have 2(two) main warnings in this message:\n\nWARNING in configuration: This warning is here because, as I mentioned in the beginning, Webpack has support for production and development environments, so when you don't specify which environment you are using, it fallbacks to production and emit this warning to let you know that you need to specify the missing info. You can modify your scripts section in package.json, editing build and adding the new build:prod:...\n\"scripts\": {\n  ...\n  \"build\": \"webpack --mode development\",\n  \"build:prod\": \"webpack --mode production\",\n  ...\n}\n...\n\nWARNING in asset/entrypoint/webpack performance: This warnings are here because Webpack is mostly focused in improve frontend application. So In order to make frontend load faster, your files must have to be smaller than 244 Kbit. So it points to you to two possible solutions: by using import/export syntax or using some hints from https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/. This is solely for app performance, for the smaller your bundles the faster they are downloaded and by using lazy loading the files will not be loaded to the memory unless needed. This is a very advanced topic so it must be covered in a dedicated post\n\nAfter modifying build and adding build:prod, if you run the build command, you won't see any warning:\n\nBut, if you run build:prod you might notice the problem with big file because of the way we are bundling momentjs:\n\nAs we have a CLI app for now, we won't 'fix' this problem as it does not bother us, unless it was a library, then we would have to find a way to decrease size to not affect our users app performance. And even worst if this was a frontend. Of course the sugested limit is 244 Kib and we have 263 Kib, so it will not affect that much, but if it was a serious frontend app or a library we would have to improve it.\nIf you check the root of your app directory you might notice, as I previously said, a new directory named dist. This directory contains one file named main.js. To run the app now, you can edit execute command in scripts:\n...\n\"scripts\": {\n  ...\n  \"execute\": \"node dist/main.js\",\n  ...\n}\n...\n\nNow you can run your \"Hello, Mr/Ms Node Dev\" app again:\n\nLet's not forget to add /dist to .gitignore or any other ignore file you have:\n...\ndist/\n...\nCustomised build configuration\nI said earlier that Webpack behaviour is to look for a file named \"index.js\" inside /src and this triggers Webpack default configuration to process your project. But there are things that this default configuration does not do for you, like processing HTML files, CSS files or transpilers like Typescript, Coffeescript, etc. To have that you have to configure Webpack by yourself and in order to do so you have to create a file named webpack.config.js inside the root of your application. \nIn webpack.config.js file you specify all the things you want to build in your application, like, compiling Typescript to Javascript(I know, I'm very obsessed with Typescript), SASS to CSS, copy the files from one directory to another (Imagine you are working with Spring for example, after the whole process you copy from /dist to /src/main/resources/static/) and other sort of nice things we will see. Create the file webpack.config.js and copy the below example, that has the same default configuration you have when you do not have the file:\nconst path = require(\"path\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: \"./src/index.js\", //1\n  output: { //2\n    filename: \"main.js\",\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, \"dist\")\n  },\n  devtool: \"source-map\" //3\n};\n\n\nentry: This is where you tell Webpack which is your \"main\" file. The one who starts your whole application. Webpack is meant to be used with SPA(Single Page Application). But it does not prevent you from making a normal MPA(Multiple Page Application), it is just more focused for SPA. By default Webpack looks for /src/index.js, but here you can change it to whatever you like and wherever you want to put this file. It can be /src/app.js or /myapp/src/my_main_file.js, you decide\noutput: Here you define your bundle options. Usually we only have one file, main.js and we are telling Webpack we want to store it in the root of our application in a directory named dist, which will be created in case it does not exist. If you don't like this location you are free here to say where you want this directory and which name you want. So you can ignore this directory in your .gitignore, .dockerignore or any ignore file you might be using. There are other options here to configure your app to have more bundle files if needed to speed download or similar problems\ndevtool: This field controls how process source mapping to better debug your application. I'm using source-map value that means, create the \"'my_js_filename'.js.map\" file, helping browsers to debug your app. You can find more info here\n\nAs you can see, this is a veeeeery simple config.\nPlugins\nA plugin is an extension made specifically for Webpack. Because of that, it can modify the files adding and removing things instead of simply reading your file and creating a new modified one. Aside from the fact some of them can allow you to choose in which phase of the building lifecycle you want to execute it. To add a plugin you have to first use NPM to install it(or code your own =D), import in your webpack.config.js, then instance it and write a plugin field to let Webpack know that you will use it as you will see bellow:\nconst path = require(\"path\");\nconst MyPlugin = require(\"myPlugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: ...,\n  output: ...,\n  devtool: ...,\n  plugins: [\n    new MyPlugin(params_if_it_has_any, ...)\n  ]\n};\nAuto deleting self generated files to avoid old cache\nOne of the annoyest problems in development world is old caches. You are coding like a locomotive, completely excited with a lot of ideas in your mind and then you run you new code and Boom... nothing changed in your app. You recompile, you refresh your browser, open it in Incognito and nothing, old page is static in front of you. You delete part of you code to force an error and nothing. Then you remember about the cache, delete it and your application is running your new code. The code you changed 1000 times trying to find what was wrong after 3 days of debug. \nOne way to prevent cache is not having old files and to delete them you  can add an webpack plugin: Clean Webpack plugin. This plugin deletes everything in your output.path property in our webpack.config.js. It deletes the content, not the directory. In order to use it first install it:\nnpm install -save-dev clean-webpack-plugin@3.0.0\n\nNow we import it in our webpack.config.js file and add it to the plugins property array:\nconst path = require(\"path\");\nconst { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require(\"clean-webpack-plugin\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: ...,\n  output: ...,\n  devtool: ...,\n  plugins: [\n    new CleanWebpackPlugin()\n  ]\n};\n\nNow our problem is solved. Whenever you execute build or build:prod, before it starts compiling the application it will delete /dist contents so you will always have the newest versions of the files you are generating.\nLoaders\nLoaders are apps that were not made specifically for Webpack to do transformation, validation or modification in some files in your project. Like for example, Typescript(told ya), Coffeescript and SASS transpilers. They were created for you to use whenever you like in whatever way you want, platform indepent. So to use them in Webpack you will need to find or create a loader, a small extension for Webpack that teaches how to execute these CLI applications giving your files as input. Then after this loader is created and imported in your project, you can go to your webpack.config.js and tell which files you want to apply these loaders and which parameter you want to provide. Usually you specify the files by using a regexp to fetch them by their file extension like /\\.(js|jsx)$/ or /\\.ts$/. To add loaders you have to add a new property named module and a array of rules like bellow example:\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: ...,\n  output: ...,\n  devtool: ...,\n  plugins: ...,\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.ts$/\n        use: {\n          loader: \"typescript-loader\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n};\nBabel\nNowadays we have at least 3(three) major versions of Javascript: ES5, ES6 and ES2018. Both of them have differences and some browsers have partially implemented them. So let's say you want to use all new syntax from ES2018 but you are affraid that not all your users use updated browsers or even that browsers does not have a good and stable implementation of some features you are interested in(like import/export).\nA good solution we have today is to use Babel. Babel is a transpiler from Javascript to Javascript, so you can code in ES2018 and compile (or in this case transpile) to an older version of Javascript that browsers and even NodeJS have already mastered. In order to do that, you have to specify a loader in your Webpack config. So first thing is add Babel:\nnpm install --save-dev babel-loader@8.1.0 @babel/core@7.9.0 @babel/preset-env@7.9.0\n\nNow change your webpack config file to add the loader:\n...\nmodule: {\n  rules: [\n    {\n      test: /\\.(js|jsx)$/,\n      exclude: /node_modules/, // We don't want babel to try to transpile all js file, only the ones in our project\n      use: [\"babel-loader\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n...\n\nThe next step is to create a configuration file for Babel in the root of your project named babel.config.js:\nmodule.exports = {\n  presets: [\n    [\n      \"@babel/preset-env\",\n      {\n        targets: {\n          node: \"current\",\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n};\n\nNow we can change our require/module.export statements in our app to import/export. Let's first start with /src/javascript/greetings/DateTimeGreeting.js:\nimport moment from \"moment\";\n\nexport default class DateTimeGreetings {\n  greetDateTime(dateFormat){\n    return `It is: ${moment().format(dateFormat)}`;\n  }\n}\n\nYes, you have to remove module.exports.DateTimeGreetings = DateTimeGreetings;. Now update /src/javascript/greetings/Greeting.js:\nimport DateTimeGreetings from \"./DateTimeGreetings.js\";\n\nexport default class Greetings {\n  ...// Keep constructor as it is  \n  greet(){\n    return `Hello Mr/Ms ${this.name}\\n${this.dateTimeGreeter.greetDateTime(\"MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a\")}`;\n  }\n}\n\nYes, you have to remove module.exports.Greetings = Greetings;. Now the last change is in /src/index.js:\nimport Greetings from \"./javascript/greetings/Greetings.js\";\n...\n\nThe reason I was not using import/export before, is because the Node version I'm using in this project(Node v12.14.1) does not support such statements. Instead of waiting for Node to add this functionality, Babel helps us converting import/export to the old syntax we were using earlier require/module.exports. But not only import/export is added. What tells Babel which JS version we are using and to which version we want it to be compiled, is that preset. By using @babel/preset, we are delegating to whoever created this preset to select which JS versions we want to go from and which one to go to. With this preset we have import/export, const, let, object destructuring and many other nice things. You can create your own preset if you want, just follow this link.\nImport path resolution\nYou might or might not have noticed a difference when importing momentjs and when importing our Greetings.js/DateTimeGreetings files. If you haven't noticed, we are using relative import, that means we, as the developers, should know where the file we want to import is in relation to the file importing it and pass the correct path. So instead of simply use:\nimport Greetings from \"greetings/Greetings\";\n\nWe have to use:\nimport Greetings from \"./javascript/greetings/Greetings\";\n\nNow imagine our Greeting class receives an instance of another class. Let's create a Person class to better ilustrate. Go to /src/javascript and create a new directory/package named person and inside it create a new file named Person.js and put the following content:\nexport default class Person {\n  constructor(name, surname){\n    this.name = name;\n    this.surname = surname;\n  }\n}\n\nNow we import it in both /src/index.js and in /src/javascript/greetings/Greeting.js. First in /src/javascript/greetings/Greeting.js:\nimport DateTimeGreetings from \"./DateTimeGreetings.js\";\nimport Person from \"../person/Person.js\";\n\nexport default class Greetings {\n  constructor(person = new Person(\"Unnamed\", \"Person\")){\n    this.person = person;\n    this.dateTimeGreeter = new DateTimeGreetings();\n  }\n  \n  greet(){\n    const {name, surname} = this.person;\n    return `Hello Mr/Ms ${name} ${surname}\\n${this.dateTimeGreeter.greetDateTime(\"MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a\")}`;\n  }\n}\n\nNow in /src/index.js:\nimport Person from \"./javascript/person/Person.js\";\nimport Greetings from \"./javascript/greetings/Greetings.js\";\n\nconst p = new Person(\"Node\", \"Dev\");\nlet greetDev = new Greetings(p);\n\nconsole.log(greetDev.greet());\n\nDo you see the difference? The more files you have, the worst it will be if for example in the future we change /src/javascript/person to something like /src/javascript/models/person, because then we will have to change everywhere else that is importing Person class and whatever Person class import(In case it imports something in the future). So to improve it and make Webpack work for us instead, let's add module resolution:\n...\nmodule.exports = {\n  entry: ...,\n  output: {...},\n  devtool: ...,\n  plugins: [...],\n  module:{...},\n  resolve: {\n    modules: [path.resolve(__dirname, \"src/javascript\"), \"node_modules\"]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNow we are saying: for whatever module I'm importing, first, look for it in /src/javascript then if you cannot find it, look inside node_modules. Then change our /src/index.js file to this:\nimport Person from \"person/Person\";\nimport Greetings from \"greetings/Greetings\";\n...\n\nAnd your /src/javascript/greetings/Greetings.js to:\nimport DateTimeGreetings from \"greetings/DateTimeGreetings\";\nimport Person from \"person/Person\";\n\nexport default class Greetings {\n...\n\nDo you see how things are more normalized now? It is because everything is using /src/javascript as a reference instead of the file you are importing to. \nTesting in Javascript with Webpack\nIf you have tried to run our old tests, you have seen that we have a problem now. We changed old require/module.exports syntax in our Greeting.js/DateTimeGreetings.js files to use import/export syntax byt not in the tests:\n\nTo fix that, we have to do 3(three) things:\n\n\nChange all require to import. Let's start with /test/javascript/greetings/DateTimeGreetings.js\nimport sinon from \"sinon\";\nimport DateTimeGreetings from \"greetings/DateTimeGreetings\";\n...\n\nNow, change /test/javascript/greetings/Greetings.js:\nimport sinon from \"sinon\";\nimport Greetings from \"greetings/Greetings\";\nimport DateTimeGreetings from \"greetings/DateTimeGreetings\";\n...\n\n\nIf you run the tests now, you'll see that they cannot find the modules greetings/Greetings.js and greetings/DateTimeGreetings.js. This is due to the fact that Jest does not know about our Path Resolution in Wepback. So to fix that, we're going to create a new file in the root of our project, named jest.config.js and in this file we will configure the modules resolution as we did in Webpack:\n   module.exports = {\n     \"moduleDirectories\":[\"src/javascript\", \"node_modules\"]\n   }\n\n\nThe last change is to fix /test/javascript/greetings/Greetings.js, because we added a new class Person to substitute the simple String we had in the first parameter in Greetings constructor:\nimport sinon from \"sinon\";\nimport Greetings from \"greetings/Greetings\";\nimport DateTimeGreetings from \"greetings/DateTimeGreetings\";\nimport Person from \"person/Person\";\n\nconst person = new Person(\"NodeJS\", \"Dev\");\nconst greetDev = new Greetings(person);\n...\n\ntest(`should return \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJS Dev\\\\nIt is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\"`, function() {\n  //GIVEN\n  const expected = \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJS Dev\\nIt is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\";      \n  //WHEN\n  const actual = greetDev.greet();\n  //THEN\n  expect(actual).toEqual(expected);\n});\n\ntest(`should not return \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJS Dev \\\\nIt is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\"`, function() {\n  //GIVEN\n  const expected = \"Hello Mr/Ms NodeJS Dev \\nIt is: April 30rd 2020, 10:20:00 pm\";      \n  //WHEN\n  const actual = greetDev.greet();\n  //THEN\n  expect(actual).not.toEqual(expected);\n});\n...\n\n\nYes, we don't need to give the full path to the classes we are importing anymore. Now you can run it again and see your tests working as they should:\n\nAnd here we finish Webpack basic tutorial, I hope you have learned and understood well everything I taught ^^\nConclusion\nIn this post we learned how Webpack works and how it can helps us improve productivity.
